# ga_page_engagement_analysis
# Google Analytics Page Engagement Analysis

This Python script analyzes data collected from the official **Google Analytics 4 demo account**, focusing on:
- The average engagement time across all pages
- A list of pages where users spent above-average time
- A sorted output of those high-performing pages by time spent

The data reflects what I observed on **July 28, 2025**, while exploring the Realtime and Pages reports in GA4. The data was transcribed manually into Python for analysis.

Skills practiced:
- Handling dictionaries and lists
- Using list comprehensions
- Filtering and aggregating data
- Sorting with `key=lambda`
- Interpreting user engagement metrics

Tools: Mu Editor | Python 3.x

Purpose: Part of my daily Python practice and learning log as I work toward junior roles in tech (data, QA, analytics).
